## Our First Step

Minecraft Season 1 was our first step towards playing minecraft in a multiplayer environment, hosted in our instance, and thanks to [TheIndianOtaku](https://github.com/theindianotaku) for all the modding, we were able to enjoy minecraft with a whole new experience.

## Experiences

### Taking break before going to an Adventure
